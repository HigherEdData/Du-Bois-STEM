Du Bois and his collaborators in 1900. Before doing the interactive exercise, please read this article about the Du Bois Challenge: **[here](https://nightingaledvs.com/the-dubois-challenge/)**. You can find the latest Du Bois visualizations by searching for the **[#DuBoisChallenge2025](https://x.com/ajstarks/status/1886397437025067162)** hash tag on social (Twitter, Bluesky, Insta etc).

The code sets with a figure width of 11 and a height of 14 to match Du Bois' dimensions. The code also sets the background color to be **antiquewhite** to resemble Du Bois: ```fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(11, 14), facecolor=\"antiquewhite\")```. ```plt``` again designates the function is from the matplot lib library.\n",

The range is from 0 to y1, our variable for percent enslaved: ```x, 0, y1, color=\"black\"```\n",
