Du Bois and his collaborators in 1900. Before doing the interactive exercise, please read this article about the [Du Bois Challenge](https://nightingaledvs.com/the-dubois-challenge/) You can find the latest Du Bois visualizations by searching for the [#DuBoisChallenge2025](https://github.com/ajstarks/dubois-data-portraits/tree/master/challenge/2025) hash tag on social media (Twitter, Bluesky, Insta etc). And you can even use the hashtag to share your own recreations.\n",

    "2. You will reproduce Du Bois' visualization using data on Black population in the US today. Du Bois used cartography to the show geographical patterns of enslavement and emancipation for Black Americans.\n",
    "3. An important context of Du Bois's map is history of the African slave trade. The first visual in the 1900 exhibition is a map of world and lines showing the transatlantic slave trade.

    "### 9. **Understanding Choropleth Maps** and Using **GeoPandas** to plot a **choropleth map**\n",
    "**Choropleth maps** are a popular way to visualize spatial data. They can be used to show data across geographic units by using coloring geographic units based on a color that corresponds to a value. For example, the count of a species across zip codes or the average household income by census tract. A common choropleth map will shade higher numbers in darker colors and lower numbers are shaded in ligther colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word choropleth comes from the Greek choro, meaning \"region.\" These maps are designed to show data at the regional level, so they’re best used with data tied to specific areal units—think polygons on a map, like the shape of Merced County or the state of California.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because choropleth maps aggregate data by geographic unit, we often need to group our data into a smaller number of categories, or classes. This step is called *classification*. Each class gets its own color, and all regions that fall within the same class are shaded the same. This helps simplify complex data so that it’s easier to interpret visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "While modern mapping software allows us to create unclassed maps—where every unique value gets its own symbol or color—there are still good reasons to use classed choropleths. Grouping data reduces visual clutter and helps map readers focus on patterns rather than being overwhelmed by too much detail. It’s a balance between simplification and meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "According Dr. Erin Hestir, there are three key steps to creating effective choropleth maps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **How many classes should I use?** Too many, and the map gets confusing; too few, and important detail is lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What classification method should I apply?** Options include equal interval, quantiles, natural breaks, and more—each tells a slightly different story.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How should I symbolize the data?** Thoughtful color choice matters. The color scheme needs to reflect the underlying pattern without misleading the viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In sum, choropleth maps help us communicate non-spatial information—like health outcomes or economic indicators—through the spatial lens of a map. They sit at the intersection of data science, geography, and design, offering a powerful way to explore and share insights about our world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this workbook, we will review these steps. We hope by the end of the session, you will discover why choropleth maps are an effective data visualization technique. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to create **choropleth map** in **GeoPandas** simply by choosing a variable.\n",

    "## Step 13 Data Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "When visualizing geographic data, especially through choropleth maps, we often need to group similar values together into categories. This process—called **data classification**—involves assigning attribute values to a limited number of meaningful groups, or classes. Classification simplifies continuous or complex datasets into interpretable patterns, making it easier to compare and communicate information through maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of cartography and spatial analysis, classification is particularly important for **quantitative attributes** (such as population density or income), where values exist on ordinal, interval, or ratio scales and can be ordered. Grouping these values into classes helps reduce visual complexity while still preserving important trends and differences. This is not only useful for single-map interpretation, but also for **temporal or spatial comparison**, such as examining changes in Black population density across centuries or between regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data classification also has implications beyond visual clarity. The choice of classification method directly shapes how the user perceives the underlying data. For example, classifying continuous population values into five categories can reveal regional trends that might be obscured in an unclassed map. Similarly, choosing one classification scheme over another—like quantiles versus natural breaks—can highlight or mask certain spatial patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the goal of classification is to **enhance map readability while retaining analytical integrity.** As you’ll see in this section, selecting the number of classes and how data is grouped isn't arbitrary—it’s a crucial design decision that affects both the **accuracy** and **interpretability** of your map.\n"

    "## Common Data Classification Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you decide to classify your data, the next important step is choosing a **classification method.** Each method follows a different logic for dividing the data into classes, and the method you choose can significantly influence how patterns are perceived on the map. Below are some of the most commonly used approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Equal Interval**\n",
    "This method divides the range of values into **equal-sized intervals.** Each class spans the same numerical distance, regardless of how the data are distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Best for: Uniformly distributed data\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Drawback: Can obscure meaningful variation in skewed data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Quantiles**\n",
    "Quantiles divide the dataset so that each class contains an **equal number of features** (e.g., states or counties).\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Best for: Highlighting relative ranking or comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Drawback: Class breaks may fall between very different values\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Natural Breaks (Jenks)**\n",
    "This method identifies natural groupings and gaps in the data using statistical optimization. It minimizes variance within classes and maximizes variance between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Best for: Skewed or clustered data\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Drawback: Classes may be unevenly populated\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Standard Deviation**\n",
    "Class breaks are based on how far values deviate from the mean. This is useful when comparing values to an average or identifying outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Best for: Normally distributed data or emphasizing deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Drawback: Not intuitive for general audiences\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Manual Classification**\n",
    "You choose the class breaks yourself based on domain knowledge or meaningful thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Best for: Custom comparisons or policy-relevant thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Drawback: Can introduce subjectivity or bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method reveals different patterns in the same dataset. It's important to experiment and think critically about which classification best supports your map’s purpose. In the next section, you'll learn how to apply these classification methods in Python using the `mapclassify` library with `GeoPandas`.\n",
