    "The #DuBoisChallenge is a call to scientists, students, and community members to recreate, adapt, and share on social media the data visualzations created by W.E.B. Du Bois and his collaborators in 1900. Before doing the interactive exercise, please read this article about the Du Bois Challenge: **[here](https://nightingaledvs.com/the-dubois-challenge/)** . You can find the latest Du Bois visualizations by searching for the **[#DuBoisChallenge2025](https://x.com/ajstarks/status/1886397437025067162)** hash tag on social (Twitter, Bluesky, Insta etc). And you can even use the hashtag to share your own recreations.\n",

    "### In this interactive excercise, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn how to create a variation of a **bar graph.**\n",
    "2. Learn and modify code in the statistical programming lanugage **Python**.\n",
    "3. Learn how to write statistical code to:\n",
    "    * create visualizations that consistently and accurately represent your data\n",
    "    * create a transparent record of exactly how you visualized something\n",
    "    * make it easy for you or others to recreate or modify your visualization\n",

    "\n",
    "2. You will reproduce Du Bois' visualization using data on Black college attainment in the US today. This aligns with how Du Bois saw mass education as one important strategy for furthering and deepining emancipation for Black Americans and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. An important context of Du Bois's graph of Black illiteracy is that literacy was illegal for enslaved people in the U.S. until emancipation and the Confederacy's defeat during the Civil War. Illiteracy then declined rapidly as Black Americans sought to empower themselves through education. The Du Bois plotted this decline in illiteracy among Black residents in the state of Georgia in the figure below. They used decennial US census illiteracy rates for Georgia from 1860 to 1890 that are available **[here](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101025729177&seq=49)**. They likely wrote \"50%?\" for the 1900 illiteracy rate because the Census did not publish 1900 illiteracy rates (available **[here](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1900/bulletins/demographic/8-negroes-in-us-part-1.pdf)**) until several months after the Paris Exposition.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first step for data visualization in **Python** is to **read** the data into an table, which is typically called a **dataframe** in python. This is like double clicking a file to open it in other computer programs. But with **Python**, we use code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we're going to import data for the illiteracy by country bar graph from our Du Bois STEM website. And we're going to place the data into a dataframe named **d_literacy_country**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no record of the exact data used by the Du Bois team for this bar graph. And the Du Bois graph curiously does not include tick marks with a labeled axis scale to show what exact values each bar represents. Why? Perhaps the Du Bois team wanted to emphasize that the bar graph was a rough comparison of illiteracy rates because of varied timing, methods, and national boundaries for measuring illiteracy rates at the time. The length of the \"Negroes U.S.A\" bar likely represents the national Black illiteracy rate of 57.1% reported by the 1890 US Census (see  reported \"Russie\" (Russia) bar correspond to the national US Black illiteracy rate in the 1890 US Census (see **[here](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1900/bulletins/demographic/8-negroes-in-us-part-1.pdf)**). So our data derives illiteracy rates for other countries based on the length of each country's bar relative to \"Negroes U.S.A.\" bar, presuming the \"Negroes U.S.A.\" bar represents 57.1%.    \n",
    "\n",
    "To import this data, we will execute 5 lines of code that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the **pandas** library of python code with functions for working with tables and dataframes. The code to import the library is: ```import pandas as pd```. \n",
    "2. While we're at it, import the **matplotlib.pyplot** library with functions for creating data visualizations from our dataframes. We'll use these functions to create our barchart next.\n",
    "3. Create a url variable that contains the url address where our dataset is located on Github with the code:\n",
    "```url = \"web_address_with_data/data_file_name.csv\")```\n",
    "4. We read the data into our d_literacy_country **data frame** from the .csv file at our url with the code: ```d_literacy_country = pd.read_csv(url)```. ```pd``` tells python that the ```read_csv``` function is from our **pandas** library.\n",
    "5. Finally, on a seprate line, we just write the name of our dataframe ```d_literacy_country```. This creates a scrollable table to browse our data.\n",

    "1. Repeat the code below that we wrote above to **import** the Du Bois illiteracy data and load the pandas and matplotlib libraries.\n",
    "2. Add a line of code that uses the **subplots** function of matplot lib to set up the overall figure (**fig**) to contain an **ax** subplot object that will generate our bargraph by using an **ax** class of of matplotlib functions (ax is short for the x and y axes of plot). The code sets with a figure width of 11 and a height of 14 to match Du Bois' dimensions. The code also sets the background color to be **antiquewhite** to resemble Du Bois: ```fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(11, 14), facecolor=\"antiquewhite\")```. ```plt``` again designates the function is from the matplot lib library.\n",
    "3. Add a line of code that executes a **barh** (bar horizontal chart) from the **ax** class of matplotlib functions to create the bargraph withhin the **ax** object ```ax.barh``` followed by open parenthese.\n",
    "4. On the line below the open parentheses, we tell Python the dataframe (d_literacy_country) and the variable from which we are plotting separate bars by country along the y-axis.\n",

The home owners loan corporation (HOLC) tracked neighborhoods that would have been redlined by the Federal Housing Adminsation and local lenders, making it harder to get affordable homeloans in the neighborhood and \"serving as a proxy for numerous prior and existing racialized policies at the federal, state, and local level that reinforced racial segregation, discrimination, and disinvestment\" (Estian et al. 2024).
