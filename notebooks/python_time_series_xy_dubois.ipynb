    "1. Import the **pandas** library of python code with functions for working with tables and dataframes. The code to import the library is: ```import pandas as pd```. \n",
    "2. While we're at it, import the **matplotlib.pyplot** library with functions for creating data visualizations from our dataframes. We'll use these functions to create our chart next. Import the **numpy** library with functions for computing sequences of numbers and statistics for plotting with **matplotlib.pyplot**.\n",

    "```url = \"web_address_with_data/data_file_name.csv\")```\n",
    "4. We read the data into our df **data frame** from the .csv file at our url with the code: ```d_literacy_country = pd.read_csv(url)```. ```pd``` tells python that the ```read_csv``` function is from our **pandas** library.\n",
