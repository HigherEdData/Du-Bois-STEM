Du Bois and his collaborators in 1900. Before doing the interactive exercise, please read this article about the Du Bois Challenge: **[here](https://nightingaledvs.com/the-dubois-challenge/)** . You can find the latest Du Bois visualizations by searching for the **[#DuBoisChallenge2025](https://x.com/ajstarks/status/1886397437025067162)** hash tag on social (Twitter, Bluesky, Insta etc).

An important context of Du Bois's graph of Black illiteracy is that literacy was illegal for enslaved people in the U.S. until emancipation and the Confederacy's defeat during the Civil War.  illiteracy then declined rapidly as Black Americans sought to empower themselves through education.

    "1. Import the **pandas** library of python code with functions for working with tables and dataframes. The code to import the library is: ```import pandas as pd```. \n",
    "2. While we're at it, import the **matplotlib.pyplot** library with functions for creating data visualizations from our dataframes. We'll use these functions to create our barchart next.\n",

    "```url = \"web_address_with_data/data_file_name.csv\")```\n",
    "4. We read the data into our d_literacy_country **data frame** from the .csv file at our url with the code: ```d_literacy_country = pd.read_csv(url)```. ```pd``` tells python that the ```read_csv``` function is from our **pandas** library.\n",

    "2. Add a line of code that uses the **subplots** function of matplot lib to set up the overall figure (**fig**) to contain an **ax** subplot object that will generate our bargraph by using an **ax** class of of matplotlib functions (ax is short for the x and y axes of plot). The code sets with a figure width of 11 and a height of 14 to match Du Bois' dimensions. The code also sets the background color to be **antiquewhite** to resemble Du Bois: ```fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(11, 14), facecolor=\"antiquewhite\")```. ```plt``` again designates the function is from the matplot lib library.\n",
    "3. Add a line of code that executes a **barh** (bar horizontal chart) from the **ax** class of matplotlib functions to create the bargraph withhin the **ax** object ```ax.barh``` followed by open parenthese.\n",
